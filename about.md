### Some More Information

As a person, I am a builder at the core. I revel in the process of building something like a house, a car, a kitchen crew, an application, or a nice piece of furniture. There is magic at work in the conception, the execution, and the finishing. My first computer came as a kit, and I soldered all the components onto the motherboard. That Sinclair ZX81 is now a museum piece with its 1 KB of RAM and storage on compact audio cassettes. Just look for it online and have a good laugh!

I have worked as a chef in every capacity from working the line in New York City restaurants to catering private events and parties of 3000-plus guests. It is a tough job but I love it; itâ€™s just the kind of job one cannot do well if not totally taken by it. I was blessed to befriend great people and be part of great teams, whether for a royal wedding in Qatar, the opening of a fine dining restaurant in the MoMA, or as the executive chef for a hunting lodge in the middle of South Dakota.

Before relocating to New York, I experienced different professions, some more and some less in line with my background in law school and accounting. As a sales rep for construction products, I was more interested in learning from my prospective clients about their trade than actually selling them stuff. I also worked in several companies as an administrator or group manager. In those roles I usually had the additional responsibilities of an IT or IT liaison.

I now look forward to returning to the tech side as I rediscover the wonderful world of web development and coding as a Fullstack Academy graduate . It is an awesome adventure I am so thrilled to embark on.

What I bring to the table:

- Customer oriented
- Result driven
- Team player, as a lead or a member
- Great aptitude to learn fast and react fast
