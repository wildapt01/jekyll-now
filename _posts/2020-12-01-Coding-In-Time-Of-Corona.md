title: Coding In Time Of Corona
---

Gabriel Garca Marquez will excuse my admittedly poor pun on his superb book’s title, but it was hard to resist! By the way, if you haven’t read "Love in Time of Cholera", do yourself a favor and pick it up for a treat. It's a true masterpiece and a must-read, even more so if you can read in its original Spanish.

Going back to our subject. Times are hard: political uncertainty, COVID-19, working from home, dealing with a lot of stress in our daily life. We all try to cope as best as possible and I thought it could be useful to share a few tidbits on how it’s done here, in our home. Maybe it is the place for a bit of background; I started my first job as a developer in January 2020, then it’s been WFH since mid-March. I work for a small non-profit, revamping their main app’s UI from the bottom up. We are mainly a .NET shop with SQL Server. Our frontend is JavaScript/CSS/HTML with a bit of jQuery and Bootstrap.

On a side note, I am very happy there and I really enjoy my job. Unlike a lot of people I know, I still have a job... The immense majority of my buddies in the food business are mostly out of work and it's really a disaster for them and the whole industry. I left the business 3 years ago and switch to software engineering, just in time it seems.
